## 🎯 The Challenge

### Project Summary
In this project, you will use Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) public loan application data, including applicant financial profiles, property details, and lender information, and supervised machine learning techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, and gradient boosting to build a model that predicts mortgage approval or denial outcomes. This will help our company address the challenge of identifying key drivers of lending decisions, surfacing potential bias across demographic groups, and improving transparency and fairness in the mortgage approval process.

### Success Criteria
AUC-ROC Score of 0.80 or above, F1 Score/Precision-Recall balance, Fairness Metrics (demographic parity, equalized odds), and a clear, interpretable model with a bias audit report.

### Project Milestones

Use these milestones to guide your work. Your team will create a **GitHub Projects board** to track tasks within each milestone.

| Month | Milestone | Key Activities |
|---|---|---|
| September | Data & Exploration | • Download and understand the HMDA public dataset<br>• Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA): distributions, missing values, class imbalance<br>• Clean and preprocess data (encoding, normalization, handling nulls)<br>• Define the target variable and finalize feature set<br>• Establish a simple baseline model (e.g. logistic regression) |
| October | Modeling & Iteration | • Train and compare multiple ML models (decision trees, random forest, gradient boosting)<br>• Tune hyperparameters and evaluate using appropriate metrics (AUC-ROC, F1, precision/recall)<br>• Conduct fairness/bias analysis across demographic groups (race, gender, income)<br>• Identify the most predictive features via feature importance analysis<br>• Document findings and iterate on model performance |
| November | Insights & Delivery | • Finalize the best-performing model and validate on held-out test data<br>• Build a clear summary of bias findings and their business implications<br>• Create visualizations and a stakeholder-friendly dashboard or report<br>• Prepare and deliver a final presentation with recommendations<br>• Document the full pipeline for reproducibility and handoff |

> **Note for the team:** Please create a GitHub Projects board in this repository to break these milestones into weekly tasks. Go to the **Projects** tab → **New project** → Choose **Board** → Add columns for each month.

## 🤝 How We'll Work Together

**Official check-ins:** During our biweekly 45-minute AI Studio Lab Section meeting block (2nd and 4th week of every month)


**Other ways to reach out to me with questions:** 
* Your team's channel within Break Through Tech’s Discord space
* CA's email: Balogundavid98@gmail.com
* I will aim to respond within 48 hours. Please reach out to your AI Studio Coach with urgent questions.


free coding / collaboration tools**
* Google Colab — free Jupyter notebooks with dynamic access to NVIDIA T4 GPUs (roughly 15–30 hours/week, sessions capped around 12 hours). Fine for your logistic regression/decision tree/gradient boosting work — none of these need heavy GPU power, so the free tier is plenty. Easiest way for a team to share and co-edit a notebook without any local setup.
  
* Kaggle Notebooks — free, ~30 hours/week of GPU (P100 or T4), and it sits right next to your dataset and the existing EDA notebooks I found earlier — you can fork one of those directly and start from it with zero setup.
  
* GitHub — free for public and private repos, unlimited collaborators on the free plan. This is where your team should host the actual project repo (code, notebooks, README, final report).
  
* Visual Studio Code — completely free, open-source, cross-platform. For this project it gives you a much more capable local development environment than Jupyter alone: proper debugging, Git integration built in, and a huge extension ecosystem. Good fit once you move past pure notebook experimentation into building a cleaner, structured codebase (data cleaning scripts, model training pipeline, fairness audit modules) that your team will eventually put in the GitHub repo.
